# README

Template for project 1 proposals, work, code, etc.

First, consider that projects are 40%, so 20% each.  Each homework is 5%.  So, the effort should be on part with 4 homeworks.  Some of the project focus should be on "polish," which is a different sort of task from basic exercises.

Options:

  1. Work alone or in pairs to propose and solve a complex engineering problem.  That's generic, for sure.  My suggestion is to dig through your 500-level course textbooks and pick out some sort of "computational" or "challenge" or three-start problem.
  
  2. Continue your past project (DMX or otherwise).
  
  3. Work on your own to solve 12+ new Code Wars problems in another language.  Choose problems appropriate to your skill level (i.e., if you already have high honor, try to continue to "rank up" in another language).
  
 
Add a proposal to this repository named `proposal.md`.
